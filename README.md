## Advent of Code 2020: Rust

This year, I'm once again going to attempt to do at least some of the solutions in Rust!

If you're also working through AoC, be forewarned that there are spoilers in here.

1. [Report Repair](src/day_one/)
2. [Password Philosophy](src/day_two/)
3. [Toboggan Trajectory](src/day_three/)
4. [Passport Processing](src/day_four/)
5. [Binary Boarding](src/day_five/)
